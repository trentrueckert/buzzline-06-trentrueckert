## Golf Round Live Tracker

## Overview
This repository contains a real-time golf round tracker, where a Kafka producer generates random golf round scores and stores them in dictionaries to be logged in the log folder. A Kafka consumer reads from the database and generates a line chart depicting the hole-by-hole scores of 4 golfers.

## Project Setup
### 1Ô∏è. Create and Activate Virtual Environment
Before running the scripts, set up a virtual environment:
```powershell
# Create virtual environment
py -3.11 -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Required Dependencies
Ensure all necessary libraries are installed:
```powershell
py -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
py -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

## Start Zookeeper and Kafka (2 Terminals)

If Zookeeper and Kafka are not already running, you'll need to install and get them running them.
See instructions at [SETUP-KAFKA.md](https://github.com/denisecase/buzzline-02-case/blob/main/docs/SETUP-KAFKA.md)

## Running the Producer/Consumer
### Start the Producer
Run the producer to generate the hole-by-hole and total round scores.
```powershell
py -m producers.golf_producer
```
This generates a new round (18 holes) of golf scores every 5 seconds

### Start the Consumer
Run the consumer to gather the hole/round/tournament scores and create the line chart.
```powershell
py -m consumers.golf_consumer
```
This script:
- Creates the line chart with all of the golfers' scores.
- Offsets the relative golf scores if the golfers finish the 18th hole with the same score to avoid overlap.

## Troubleshooting
It's possible that your Environment will install Kafka/zookeeper differently than mine. 
If you run into errors with Kafka/zookeeper, you can check the IP your environment is set to run them on in ~/kafka/config/server.properties and ~/kafka/config/zookeeper.properties
Contrast the these with what is configured in this repository by searching the relevant files for 2181 and 9092, the ports which kafka and zookeeper run on.
